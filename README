[10]Cnetworkmanager is a command-line client for [11]NetworkManager,
intended to supplement and replace the GUI applets. So far it is a single
python script. What is new in version 0.7.1:

  * it does not need a configuration file anymore:
    cnetworkmanager -C publicnet
    cnetworkmanager -C myessid --wep-hex 112234445566778899aabbccdd
    cnetworkmanager -C moria   --wep-pass SpeakFriendAndEnter  # 0.8
    cnetworkmanager -C another --wpa-psk-hex \
      112233445566778899aabbccddeeff00112233445566778899aabbccddeeff00
  * it works with NM 0.6 (tested on [12]Ubuntu 8.04 Hardy and a
    pre-release [13]OLPC) in addition to the older support for NM 0.7pre
    (tested on [14]openSUSE 11.0)

What is still left to do:

  * sooner:
       * reading the configuration stored by the GNOME nm-applet
       * possibility to quit after a connection is established

  * later:
       * more encryption schemes (WPA2?)
       * more connection types (dial-up, VPN)
