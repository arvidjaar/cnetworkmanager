0.21.1, Tue 2009-08-18
Fixed the --wep-* and --wpa-* options (Gentoo#281099).
Fixed --activate-connection failing with Invalid settings service name.
openSUSE 11.2: noarch again.

0.21, Mon 2009-08-10
User visible:

Added screenshots.html.
Output in a tabular form (like Tambet's nmcli); --terse/-t to disable.
Added --wireless-enabled/--we.
Added --con-info.

For unimplemented device types, return "unknown", crash not (Kevin Fenzi).
Ignore AlreadyAsleepOrAwake error (-o).
Flags with zero value now output its name (NONE) instead of nothing.

Ongoing library cleanup:

Introduced Adaptor classes: MethodAdaptor, PropertyAdaptor, SignalAdaptor.
Adding docstrings.
Always use byte_arrays=True in DBusMio.

Build fix: Removed noarch since Python has an arch dependent libdir (on
openSUSE)

0.20, Wed 2009-07-29
Major rewrite:
Created a library wrapping the NM DBus API.
Created a generic library wrapping python-dbus.
  (both libraries are still quite messy)
Dropped support for NM 0.6.
  (the last trace is in the 'breakup' branch)
Connection setting:
  --activate-connection for system settings or another applet
  --connect for exporting a transient connection
  knetworkmanager (KDE3) config reading dropped
Added a (basic) testsuite.
Switched to distutils.

Fix: RPM packaging: consistent PREFIX (bnc#485413), owning pkgdatadir.

Fix: knetworkmanagerrc: Don't let ConnectionSettings override ConnectionSecrets.
Updated pbkdf2.py to the newest upstream version (license
clarified). (Alexander Block)
